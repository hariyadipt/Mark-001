/**
 * Given three points on a plain, this class will compute the common center and the radius
 * of the circle than is defined by those points
 *
 * Date:      1 October 2011
 * Author    Timothy J. Mitchell (wymarc@gmail.com)
 *
 * (Modified from other sources-see below)
 *
 * This is modification based loosely on the C example code circle3 routine by
 * James Morrison published in The Astrolabe
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * There are two boundary conditions that must be dealt with:
 * 	1. If two of the points have the same y-axis co-ordinate (i.e. 12,7; 87,7)
 * this can cause a divide-by-zero error in the code
 *
 * 	2. If all three points lie on the same line, there is no circle that they define.
